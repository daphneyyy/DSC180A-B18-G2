## Task Name: Text Multi-Classification
### Task Summary: 
Using Bert Model to do text multi-classification. We aim to use a Large Language Model such as Bert to encode the transaction information for each consumer and predict the exact transaction category. There are a total of nine transaction categories to predict. We first clean the transaction information column in the dataset. Then we use the train test split and stratify method to split the dataset into train, validation, and test datasets. In the end, we implement the Bert model, train the model, and evaluate the model performance on the test set. 
### Running Command: 
    python3 run.py
### Careful⚠️：
Since it's our first time to use py file in the github and create the main function call, we are not familiar with this skill so the template is not perfect. We just did a basic structure for this template. If the above command can not run in terminal, you could just download the jupyter notebook and run it.
